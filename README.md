# Desiccant

![Desiccant](./desiccant.svg)

Managing your certificates has never been so easy.

## Description

Effortlessly create, renew and automate your X509 certificates with only pure BASH.
If like me, you dont necessarily want to provision or install on each and every server technologies like snap or python that come with Certbot, Desiccant might suite your needs.

## Release

Desiccant will be released soon, in fact I have already been using it for months. Nonetheless, I will be committing small parts at a time and while doing so, I will be refactoring, commenting and checking for possible security issues.
